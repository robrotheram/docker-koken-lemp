# Docker + Koken + nginx = â™¥

Unoffical Image for installing koken. Major difference between this and the offical container is that this uses a seperate mysql container instead of one inbuilt into the container;
## Features

* Automatically sets up and configures the database for Koken and skips that step in the installation process.
* Adds a cron job to do periodic cleanup of the image cache.
* nginx/PHP configured for best Koken performance.
* Can be used on any machine with Docker installed.
* Uses seperate mysql container 

## Prequistis
1. Have Docker installed (https://www.docker.io/gettingstarted/#h_installation).
2. have a mysql container running see here for help of starting one up https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql/

##Simple setup
